# Bankist-App
A bank application website. This project was developed as an exercise in Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course. 

Functionality:

This application provides all the basic functionality for a bank app: transfers, loans, calculating interest, as well as the multiple account support, an ability to sort your transactions or close your account altogether. The logout timer will make sure your session is safe. The date and currency display formats are customized to user's locale.

An extra feature I created myself is the option to switch between date formats: casual, showing only the day, as well as replacing the date with a more convenient description (like today, yesterday, 5 days ago, etc.); and exact, showing full date and time of the transaction. HTML/CSS turned out to be nice this time, actually.

Initial HTML/CSS by Jonas Schmedtmann.
